# Titanic-Prediction

Using titanic dataset from kaggle and try to predict whether a person survived the shipwreck. A lot of begginers are confused as to how to start when to end and everything in between, it is best project for beginners.

The goal of this project is predict whether a passenger survived or not. 0 for not and 1 for survived.

In this project, I done some basic data analysis, then some feature engineering and in the end using some models for prediction.
